# Fashion-recommendation-System
Fashion Recommender System (AWS + Docker)

This project implements a Fashion Recommendation System showcasing AWS, Docker, networking, and system fundamentals. It’s designed as a beginner-friendly project with real-world deployment patterns, making it suitable for learning cloud, containerization, and recommendation algorithms.

🚀 Features

Content-based recommendation for fashion products (clothing, accessories, etc.)

Backend API built with Python (Flask/FastAPI)

AWS deployment with S3, EC2, and IAM integration

Dockerized setup for reproducible builds

Networking fundamentals (exposed ports, API routes, Docker networking)

Logging & Monitoring basics

🛠 Tech Stack

Python – core recommendation engine

Flask / FastAPI – REST API server

Docker – containerized services

AWS (S3, EC2, IAM, ECR) – cloud deployment

PostgreSQL / SQLite – product & user metadata

Pandas / Scikit-learn – ML-based recommendations

⚡ Quickstart
1. Clone Repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fashion-recsys-aws.git
cd fashion-recsys-aws

2. Run with Docker
docker-compose up --build


API will be available at:
👉 http://localhost:5000/recommend?item_id=123

3. Deploy on AWS

Push Docker image to ECR

Launch EC2 instance

Pull image & run container

Store product images in S3

Use IAM role for secure access

📡 API Endpoints

GET /recommend?item_id=<id> → Returns top-N similar items

POST /feedback → Logs user interaction (optional)

Example:

{
  "recommendations": [
    {"id": "456", "name": "Blue Denim Jacket"},
    {"id": "789", "name": "White Sneakers"}
  ]
}

🧑‍💻 Learning Outcomes

Apply Docker + AWS fundamentals in a real project

Practice networking concepts (ports, routing, services)

Understand recommendation systems

Build a deployable ML microservice

📌 Future Improvements

Add collaborative filtering

Deploy with Kubernetes (EKS)

Integrate CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

Add real-time user personalization
